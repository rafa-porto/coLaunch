# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing core application structure
- Setting up authentication with Better-auth
- Implementing UI components with Shadcn UI
- Configuring development environment
- Setting up project documentation

## Recent Changes

- Initialized project with Next.js 15
- Set up Better-auth
- Configured TypeScript and ESLint
- Added Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
- Implemented middleware for auth
- Created memory bank documentation
- Set up project structure

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
- Using Next.js 15 App Router
- Server-first approach
- Better-auth for authentication
- Shadcn UI for components

### Development
- PNPM for package management
- Turbopack for development
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint for code quality

### UI/UX
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Shadcn UI component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Toast notifications with Sonner

## Current Considerations

### Technical
- Authentication flow optimization
- Database schema design
